My application is very easy to use.  I wrote it using Python and Flask, and use the built-in Replit key-value store database to store data.  The extra feature that I added is the ability to add locations and assign inventory items to locations.

In order to add an item, click "add item" and fill out the form.  To edit an item's name, notes, quantity or change its location, click "edit."  To remove an item, click "remove."

In order to add a location, click "add location" and fill out the form.  To edit a location, click "edit."  To delete a location, click "remove."

The application is pre-populated with some example data for you to play around with.
